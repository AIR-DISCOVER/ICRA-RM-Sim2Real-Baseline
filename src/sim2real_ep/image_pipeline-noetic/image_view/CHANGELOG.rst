-------------------
* Implemented extracting raw image data (`#329 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/329>`_)
  Implementation of the raw image extraction if the file extension is .raw. This file extension is not supported by cv::imwrite so there is be no conflict. The raw files only containing the pixel data without any meta data which allows usage in MATLAB or other tools.
* Merge pull request `#375 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/375>`_ from fizyr-forks/opencv4
* Fix OpenCV4 compatibility.
* Merge pull request `#337 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/337>`_ from yoshito-okada/fix_image_view_nodelet

* Merge pull request `#343 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/343>`_ from fkie-forks/work_around_opencv_highgui_bug
  Work around OpenCV highgui bug
  I had to remove the GTK workaround, since it creates symbol collisions between GTK2 and GTK3.
* Refresh GUI on image update as well
* Use WallTimer for backwards compatibility with ROS Indigo
* Switch to SteadyTimer as suggested in review
* Remove unused `signals` from find_package(Boost COMPONENTS ...)
  The signals library was not used at all, and it has been removed from
  boost 1.69. As a result, the package doesn't build anymore with boost
  1.69 without this change.
* While we're at it, work around the mutex assertion failure on exit
* Work around an OpenCV bug with GTK and threading
* add ThreadSageImage class to encapsilate mutex operation for image

1.12.23 (2018-05-10)
--------------------

1.12.22 (2017-12-08)
--------------------

1.12.21 (2017-11-05)
--------------------
* call namedWindow from same thread as imshow, need waitKay, now cvStartWindowThreads is null funciton on window_QT.h (`#279 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/279>`_)
* Contributors: Kei Okada

1.12.20 (2017-04-30)
--------------------
* DisparityViewNodelet: fixed freeze (`#244 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/244>`_)
* launch image view with a predefined window size (`#257 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/257>`_)
* Remove python-opencv run_depend for image_view (`#270 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/270>`_)
  The `python-opencv` dependency pulls in the system OpenCV v2.4 which is
  not required since the `image_view` package depends on `cv_bridge` which
  pulls in `opencv3` and `opencv3` provides the python library that
  `image_view` can use.
* Fix encoding error message (`#253 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/253>`_)
  * Fix encoding error message
  * Update image_saver.cpp
  Allow compilation on older compilers
* Including stereo_msgs dep fixes `#248 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/248>`_ (`#249 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/249>`_)
* Add no gui mode to just visualize & publish with image_view (`#241 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/241>`_)
* stere_view: fixed empty left, right, disparity windows with opencv3
* Apply value scaling to depth/float image with min/max image value
  If min/max image value is specified we just use it, and if not,
  - 32FC1: we assume depth image with meter metric, and 10[m] as the max range.
  - 16UC1: we assume depth image with milimeter metric, and 10 * 1000[mm] as the max range.
* Depends on cv_bridge 1.11.13 for CvtColorForDisplayOptions
  Close `#238 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/238>`_
* fix doc jobs
  This is a proper fix for `#233 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/233>`_
* address gcc6 build error
  With gcc6, compiling fails with `stdlib.h: No such file or directory`,
  as including '-isystem /usr/include' breaks with gcc6, cf.,
  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70129.
