  set_cammodel of StereoCalibrator need to override the method of parent class
  fix related to `opencv/opencv#11085 <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/11085>`_:
  unlike cv2.calibrate, the cv2.fisheye.calibrate method expects float64 points and in an array with an extra dimension. The same for cv2.stereoCalibrate vs cv2.fisheye.stereoCalibrate

1.12.23 (2018-05-10)
--------------------
* camera_checker: Ensure cols + rows are in correct order (`#319 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/319>`_)

  huge reported errors:
  ```
  $ rosrun camera_calibration cameracheck.py --size 6x7 --square 0.0495
  Linearity RMS Error: 13.545 Pixels      Reprojection RMS Error: 22.766 Pixels
  $ rosrun camera_calibration cameracheck.py --size 7x6 --square 0.0495
  Linearity RMS Error: 0.092 Pixels      Reprojection RMS Error: 0.083 Pixels
  ```
  This commit switches columns and rows around if necessary.

* Correct three errors that prevented the node to work properly.
* Contributors: Filippo Basso, Vincent Rabaud

1.12.13 (2015-04-06)

-------------------
* install scripts in the local bin (they are now rosrun-able again)
  fixes `#93 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/93>`_
* fix default Constructor for OpenCV flags
  this does not change anything in practice as the flag is set by the node.
  It just fixes the test.
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud

1.12.6 (2014-07-27)
-------------------
* make sure the GUI is started in its processing thread and fix a typo
  This fully fixes `#85 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/85>`_

* fixes `#76 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/76>`_
  Move Python approximate time synchronizer to ros_comm
* remove all trace of cv in Python (use cv2)
* remove deprecated file (as mentioned in its help)
* fixes `#25 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/25>`_
  This is just removing deprecated options that were around since diamondback
* fixes `#74 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/74>`_
  calibrator.py is now using the cv2 only API when using cv_bridge.
  The API got changed too but it seems to only be used internally.
